# PostHog Community App: Advanced GeoIP

This app extends functionality for the [GeoIP app](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-plugin-geoip). This functionality cannot be part of the main GeoIP app as that app is stateless:

1. Enables discarding IP addresses after GeoIP lookup is processed. This is particularly helpful for privacy preservation and compliance. IP addresses are considered PII in several countries.
2. Enables discarding entire GeoIP information for events that come from certain libraries. For example, you probably don't want to assign locations to users that belong to your server. I've used it to ignore IP address and GeoIP information from my backend.

## üöÄ Usage

To use it simply install the app from the repository URL: https://github.com/paolodamico/posthog-app-advanced-geoip or search for it in the PostHog App Library.
