# PostHog Community App: Advanced GeoIP

This app extends functionality for the [GeoIP app](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-plugin-geoip). This functionality cannot be part of the main GeoIP app as that app is stateless:

1. Enables discarding IP addresses after GeoIP lookup is processed. This is particularly helpful for privacy preservation and compliance. IP addresses are considered personal data in several countries.

> Previously this app enabled discarding IP information from certain libraries (to discard IP data from backend servers), this is now possible natively with PostHog, setting `$geoip_disable = true` in events. Server-side libraries have native support for this, and no additional action is required. See [posthog-node](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/node) for instance.

## üöÄ Usage

To use it simply install the app from the repository URL: https://github.com/paolodamico/posthog-app-advanced-geoip or search for it in the PostHog App Library.
